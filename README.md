# apriori algorithm
# Description:
o	Consider the sets of transactions for a Bakery in the attached file "Bakery.csv".
o	column transaction represent a set of items defined with their names at a specific time.
o	Each transaction has many items; each item is in a separate row.
o	We need to know the association between items.
# Requirements:
•	Write a program in any programming language that implements one of the association algorithms (Apriori, FP-Growth or vertical data format) on this set of transactions. 
•	Minimum support & minimum confidence should be variable as per user input during runtime.
•	Then generate all association rules which can be mined from the transactions.
•	The final output of your program should show the frequent item sets and association rules with their confidence.
